# MSP430

This repo holds a bunch of code for the TI MSP430 microcontroller. It's mostly code from exercises in [*MSP430 Microntroller Basics*](https://www.amazon.com/MSP430-Microcontroller-Basics-John-Davies/dp/0750682760) by John Davies.

All the code here can be compiled and flashed by using the Makefile(s).

### Setting up
To do anything in this repo there is some setup. We'll need a compiler, header file libs, and something to flash the firmware onto the board.

- Compiler, toolchain, headers: [msp430-gcc](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP430-GCC-OPENSOURCE)
- Flasher: [mspdebug](https://github.com/dlbeer/mspdebug)
